    "We could use a 2D array to represent the chessboard. However we get some automatic benefits if we use another representation. Specifically, we will use a 1D array of size 8. Each cell in the array stores the location of the queen in that column. This means the board state itself enforces one of the rules of the game, it is not possible to put two queens in one column.\n",

Hill-climbing methods can be applied if one is able to assign a _value_ to each state on the search path.
