    "## Connect Three \n",
    "You previously saw an example of minimax search being used to write an AI that plays perfect noughts and crosses. In this ungraded assignment you have an opportunity to apply this to another game, connect three (a modified version of [connect four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Players alternate playing pieces of their colour into any non-full column of a grid. The pieces will fall down as far as possible. The objective is to get three of the same pieces in a line: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. In this version the board will be 5 columns wide and 3 rows high. An example is shown below showing a win for the red player.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/connect3.png\" width=200 />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "You should write or adapt the minimax algorithm from the noughts and crosses example to work for connect three. The state space is much larger due to the size of the board, so the basic brute force version of the algorithm is unlikely to be computationally efficient enough to actually play against. Hence you will be required to implement some optimisations, for example:\n",
    "* Alpha-beta pruning – see the noughts and crosses example.\n",
    "* Cache results for board states – multiple paths can lead to the same state so you shouldn't have to solve these twice. You can use a dictionary to cache results efficiently.\n",
    "* Optimise for symmetry – the board is symmetric around the centre column, so you can cut down the number of necessary states by assuming that optimal play will look the same but adjusted for reflection when you are creating the cache.\n",
    "* Table lookups – like caching results but saving permanently, you can precompute a certain number of end-game board positions and store the results (e.g. calculate in one cell and then use in another).\n",
    "* Depth limit – a hard cap on the recursion limit will hugely improve performance at the cost of optimality. If the recursion limit is reached you can simply return a default value like 0, or...\n",
    "* Evaluation functions – rather than returning a default value when you hit the recursion limit, you can use a fast heuristic function to evaluate the strength of a board position for the given player. What you choose is up to you! Be creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective is to write an AI which is efficient and a strong or even optimal player. Reflect on your results once you are finished and share them in the forum. You can even try upping the game parameters to see if your code will work on the full connect four board! Note that this assignment is **ungraded**, do not feel the need to implement all of the optimisations listed above."
